I am planning to spend one month at your institute
doing work as part of our collaboration in the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

The work will consist in preparing the final analysis and report
on the end-to-end data simulation challenge results. At that time
we will have the raw data from the DESI simulation, starting
from mock galaxy catalogs and going through the 4-year of
spectroscopic observations and its corresponding data reduction.

The final analysis must characterize and report on:
1. The data pipeline computational efficiency in reducing the spectra.
2. The impact of possible observational systematics on
   reducing the efficiency to measure redshifts at the
   accuracy expected by DESI.
3. Suggest strategies to optimize the computational efficiency
   and mitigate the observational systematics.

The desired dates for my visit are October 1 2017 through November 3 2017.
I will be able to cover the costs of the airplane ticket to Paris and
living expenses (meals). I would like to request your help to cover 
my lodging expenses and transportation in the Paris region.

I am at your disposition for any additional request.

Best Regards,

Jaime E. Forero-Romero
